# Task Graph Implementation Decisions

## Overview
The Task Graph component serves as a real-time visualization of task relationships, dependencies, and operational flow within the Rolodexter4 system. This document outlines key implementation decisions and future capabilities.

## Current Implementation
- Using Recharts for initial visualization
- Mock data simulation for UI development
- Cyberpunk-inspired visual styling
- Real-time updates with animated transitions

## Future Enhancements
1. **Graph Visualization**
   - Force-directed graph layout
   - Interactive node exploration
   - Zoom and pan capabilities
   - Path highlighting between related tasks

2. **Data Integration**
   - Real-time task dependency tracking
   - Operation flow visualization
   - Historical task relationship analysis
   - Predictive connection mapping

3. **Interaction Model**
   - Node selection and focus
   - Connection strength visualization
   - Contextual task information
   - Filter and search capabilities

4. **Visual Design**
   - Neon glow effects on active paths
   - Pulse animations for data flow
   - Status-based color coding
   - HUD-style information overlay

## Technical Stack
- React + TypeScript
- Recharts (current) â†’ D3.js/Three.js (future)
- Framer Motion for animations
- Custom WebGL effects (planned)

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient node rendering
- WebGL acceleration for complex visualizations
- Optimized data structure for real-time updates
- Smart culling for large datasets

## Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation for node traversal
- Screen reader descriptions
- High contrast mode support
- Alternative data views

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic graph visualization
2. Add interactive node capabilities
3. Integrate real task data
4. Enhance visual effects
5. Add advanced filtering
