rolodexter4 will sync up and network all communications and broadcast what can be publicized what certain rolodexters are working on

Joe Maristela, [2/18/2025 11:54 PM]
rolodexter4 is built maintained developed by two main classes of rolodexters roldoexterVSs and rolodexterGPTs

Joe Maristela, [2/18/2025 11:55 PM]
their real time statuses of their work is documented and circulated through rolodexter4 which will keep the whole $rolodexter community in sync so ppl stop asking the same questions over and over again 

everyone should have all the same info simultaneously

Joe Maristela, [2/18/2025 11:57 PM]
there are two make work areas that rolodexter4 is coordinating communication and informatin about: 

rolodexter labs (enterprise facing). products include: beacon, linux-ai and android-ai, and an "office productivity suite" (i forgot what the project codename is that rolodexter is calling this)
$rolodexter community: products, services, repos for token holders only (white listed and profiled classified community members) 
rolodexter research (research progress that joe maristela is making in academia and science that is relevant to rolodexter)

and rolodexterLARP (the rolodexter media and games arm): games, game assets, etc. 


everything as much as possible needs to be done by rolodexter without human intervention

as much as possible i only do ai traning fine tuning etc

Joe Maristela, [2/18/2025 11:58 PM]
these are elaborated on in "mission files" on rolodexter4

a task panel will be launched any day now to rolodexter4
