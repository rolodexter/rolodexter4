## Status: ACTIVE

## Priority: CRITICAL

## Owner: rolodexterGPT

## Dependencies: None (Immediate fix required)

## Description

ðŸš¨ **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER**: Vercel deployment is failing due to TypeScript type mismatches in `pages/api/search.ts`. Immediate fix required to unblock deployment.

## Current Issues

1. Type mismatch between `Document` and `RawSearchResult` types
2. Build failing on Vercel deployment
3. Search functionality potentially broken

## Action Items (IMMEDIATE)

1. [ ] Apply Quick Fix to `pages/api/search.ts`

   ```typescript
   const formattedResults: SearchResult[] = (results as RawSearchResult[]).map((doc) => ({
     title: doc.title,
     path: doc.path,
     excerpt: doc.excerpt ?? "",  // Ensure field exists
     rank: doc.rank ?? 0
   }));
   ```

2. [ ] Deploy Fix

   ```sh
   git add pages/api/search.ts
   git commit -m "Quick fix for search type mismatch"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. [ ] Verify Schema (While Deploying)

   ```sh
   npx prisma format
   npx prisma validate
   npx prisma generate
   ```

4. [ ] Monitor Deployment
   - [ ] Watch Vercel build logs
   - [ ] Verify search functionality
   - [ ] Check for runtime errors

## Technical Details

### Files to Fix Immediately

- `pages/api/search.ts`

### Current Error

```
Type 'Document' is missing the following properties from type 'RawSearchResult': excerpt, rank
```

## Dependencies

- None (Removed dependencies to expedite fix)

## Risks

- Type assertion may mask underlying issues
- Potential runtime errors if fields don't exist
- Technical debt to be addressed in follow-up task

## Success Criteria

1. âœ… Vercel build passes
2. âœ… Search API returns results without errors
3. âœ… No immediate runtime errors

## Notes

- This is a temporary fix to unblock deployment
- See task `search-type-safety-improvements` for long-term solution
- Monitor error rates after deployment
